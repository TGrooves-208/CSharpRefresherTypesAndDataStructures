# Simple C# Data Types & Collection Example

A demonstration project in C# showcasing the basics of data types and collections, including examples of bytes, integers, floats, strings, arrays, lists, dictionaries, and their representations in the console. This project illustrates how to work with fundamental data types and collections in C# while using ASCII art to enhance console output.

## Project Structure

This project contains a single `Program.cs` file within the `HelloWorld` namespace and consists of examples using various data types and collections in C#.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore different C# data types (e.g., `byte`, `sbyte`, `ushort`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, `string`, `bool`).
- Illustrate the use of single and multi-dimensional arrays, lists, dictionaries, and the `IEnumerable` interface.
- Display ASCII illustrations of data for a clear understanding of data type ranges and values.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/HelloWorld.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite C# IDE (such as Visual Studio).

3. Run the program, and it will display output in the console demonstrating:
   - Byte range and representation.
   - Signed and unsigned values for integer types.
   - Differences between `float`, `double`, and `decimal`.
   - ASCII representation of single-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
   - Basic usage of `List` and `Dictionary` collections.

## Example Outputs

This project outputs a series of examples like:

```plaintext
Byte Example:
Bits: [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0] represents 0
Bits: [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1] represents 255
Byte Value: 255

1D Array (Grocery List) Visualization:

    |   Coffee   | Coffee Cake|
    +------------+------------+
```

Each data type and collection is clearly labeled and includes examples of operations and data access.

## Summary of Data Types and Collections Covered

- **Byte & SByte**: Illustrates byte ranges in 8-bit storage, signed and unsigned.
- **Integer Types**: Demonstrates usage of `ushort`, `short`, `int`, and `long`.
- **Floating Point & Decimal Types**: Explores precision differences among `float`, `double`, and `decimal`.
- **String & Boolean**: Basic string manipulation and boolean example.
- **Arrays**: One-dimensional and two-dimensional array visualization.
- **List**: Dynamically expanding collections with indexed access.
- **Dictionary**: Key-value pairs with ASCII representation for dictionary visualization.
